# 🧠 Mental Health Analysis & Prediction in Remote Work Settings

This repository contains two interlinked projects focused on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Predictive Modeling** to understand and forecast **mental health conditions of remote employees**.

---

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 📊 Mental Health EDA on Remote Jobs

A detailed exploratory data analysis aiming to:
- Uncover key insights about the mental well-being of remote workers.
- Visualize trends in productivity, burnout, and mental health support.
- Correlate job roles, work modes, and support systems with employee wellness.

### 2. 🤖 Mental Health Predictive Classification

A machine learning project that:
- Predicts whether a remote employee is likely to experience mental health issues.
- Utilizes classification models like **Logistic Regression**, **K-Nearest Neighbors**, and **Decision Trees**.
- Includes performance metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualization of predictions.

## 📌 Key Features

- 📁 Cleaned and preprocessed datasets from workplace surveys.
- 📈 Interactive Plotly visualizations for insightful exploration.
- 🧪 Applied multiple classification models for robust predictions.
- 📊 Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score.
- ✅ Binary classification: `Willing to seek help` vs `Not Willing`.
